C  This Max 8 patch creates some interesting electronic noise using a noise generator 
C  and a software simulation of Make Noise's mimeophon eurorack module. 
C
C  It begins by using a noise generation algorithm, a Max 8 version of Acreil's Pure Data 
C  noise generating abstraction from:

C
C  Next is the software simulation of Make Noise's mimeophon eurorack module. The Mimeophon 
C  music synthesizer module is a stereo, multi-zone color audio repeater by Make Noise and 
C  soundhack, coded by Tom Erbe.

C
C  Loopop proposed the coding of a Pure Data version of the mimeophon as a challenge in 
C  his Incomplete Book of Electronic Music.    
C
C  Finally, the melodic content is passed through a dattorro reverb for further effect. 
C  The mimeophon uses it's own reverb called blur.

Usage:  The file _try_again v3.maxpat is the parent patch. The other abstractions 
        are used by the parent patch.
